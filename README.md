# soft-eng-project
Project for CSCI-3340

This To-Do List Application project is all about creating a user-friendly task management platform that helps everyone stay organized and boost productivity. Designed for both regular users and admins, this web-based app makes it easy to assign, track, and complete tasks. We’re focused on building a secure login system to keep user data safe while allowing admins to create tasks that include everything from the task name and description to due dates, statuses, priority levels, and who’s responsible for each task. Users will have their own task viewer page where they can easily see what’s on their plate and update their task statuses as they make progress. We also want to ensure clear roles and permissions, so only the right people can create or manage tasks. Plus, we’re making sure the app looks great and works well on any device, so users can manage their tasks anytime, anywhere. With these features, our goal is to make collaboration smoother, streamline workflows, and give everyone a clear picture of what needs to be done, ultimately leading to greater productivity and success for all users.
